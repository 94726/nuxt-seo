Nuxt OG Image integrates with Nuxt Content out of the box.

It supports the `ogImage` frontmatter key that can be used to configure your OG Image.

This will only work when you're using Document Driven mode, or you have set a `path`.

## Setup

Simply use the `ogImage` key on your frontmatter. This has the same options as `defineOgImage`.

```md [content/blog/3-months-of-europe.md]
---
title: 3 Months of Europe
description: I went to Europe for 3 months, here's what I got up to.
ogImage:
  component: BlogOgImage
  props:
    image: /blog/3-months-of-europe.png
    readingMins: 5
---
```

If you're not using Document Driven mode, you must use the `path` key on your frontmatter.

```md [content/blog/3-months-of-europe.md]
---
title: 3 Months of Europe
description: I went to Europe for 3 months, here's what I got up to.
path: /blog/3-months-of-europe
ogImage:
  component: BlogOgImage
  props:
    image: /blog/3-months-of-europe.png
    readingMins: 5
```


### Using Components

If you'd like to use the `<OgImage />` or `<OgImageScreenshot />` components within your content, you'll need
to make the components global.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    componentOptions: {
      global: true,
    }
  }
})
```


## Guides

### Use a pre-existing OG Image

You can use a pre-existing OG Image by setting the `url` key.

```md [content/blog/3-months-of-europe.md]
---
title: 3 Months of Europe
description: I went to Europe for 3 months, here's what I got up to.
path: /blog/3-months-of-europe
ogImage:
  url: https://example.com/og.png
---
```

### Opt out from OG Images

You can also disable the OG Image by setting the key to `false`.

```md [content/blog/3-months-of-europe.md]
---
title: 3 Months of Europe
description: I went to Europe for 3 months, here's what I got up to.
path: /blog/3-months-of-europe
ogImage: false

```
