title: Runtime Browser Images
---

By default, generating browser images is disabled at runtime. This is because it requires a headless browser to be installed.

## Enabling Runtime Browser Images

If you're using a compatible environment (node) and want to enable runtime browser images, you can do so with the following steps.

1. Install the `playwright` dependency.

  ```bash
  npm i playwright
  ```

2. Enable the config

    ```ts [nuxt.config]
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
        ogImage: {
          runtimeBrowser: true
        }
    })
    ```

## Compatibility

Both Satori and Browser will work in Node based environments. Prerendering is fully supported.

When you want to generate dynamic images at runtime there are certain Nitro runtime limitations.

## Prerendering Alternative

It's recommended to use the browser provider only in prerendering to avoid a runtime headless browser dependency.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      crawlLinks: true, // recommended
      routes: [
        '/',
        // list all routes that use og:image if you're not using crawlLinks
        '/about',
        '/blog',
        '/blog/my-first-post',
      ]
    }
  }
})
```
