title: Custom Fonts
---

When creating your OG Image, you'll probably want to use a font custom to your project.

To make this easier for you, Google Fonts are loaded by default with Inter 400 and Inter 700.

You can easily load different Google Fonts by using their name+weight. For example:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    fonts: [
      // will load the Noto Sans font from Google fonts
      'Noto+Sans:400'
    ]
  }
})
```

## Supporting non-english characters


This also lets you support non-english characters by adding the appropriate font to your config.

For example, to support Hebrew characters, you can use the config:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    fonts: [
      // will load this font from Google fonts
      'Noto+Sans+Hebrew:400'
    ]
  }
})
````

## Local fonts


If you'd like to load a font locally,
then you can provide the configuration as an object:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    fonts: [
      {
        name: 'optieinstein',
        weight: 800,
        // path must point to a public font file
        path: '/OPTIEinstein-Black.otf',
      }
    ],
  }
})
```
