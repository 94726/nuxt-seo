title: Prebuilt Images
description: Use prebuilt images with Nuxt OG Image.
---

When you use `defineOgImage` with a `url` it will determine that you are using an og:image that you 
have already built. For example, one in your `public` directory, or hosted elsewhere.

Using this can be useful for overriding runtime images for specific pages.

```ts
/* app.vue */
// setting a runtime image for all pages
defineOgImage({ component: 'root' })

/* pages/static.vue */
// overriding the image using a prebuilt one
defineOgImage({ url: 'https://some-domain.png/static.png', width: 1200, height: 630, alt: 'My Image' })
```
