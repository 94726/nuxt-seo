## Nuxt Config

Remove the following keys from your Nuxt config:

- `playground` - If you have Nuxt DevTools enabled then the playground will always be enabled
- `host` - This is handled by [Nuxt Site Config](/site-config/guides/setting-site-config)
- `siteUrl` - This is handled by [Nuxt Site Config](/site-config/guides/setting-site-config)

You will need to rename the following from your Nuxt Config:
- `runtimeBrowser` -> `runtimeChromium` - Removes ambiguity on dependencies
