description: Using custom fonts in your OG Images.
---

To generate images through Satori a font is required, system fonts can't be used.

Nuxt OG Image is configured to use `Inter:400` and `Inter:700` fonts from Google Fonts by default.
This font does not support [Non-English Locales](/og-image/guides/non-english-locales), so you may need
to switch it.

There are two ways to load a font, through Google Fonts and through a local font file.

## Loading A Local Font File

Local font files must be `.otf` or `.woff` and be within the `public` directory.

For example, if you have a font file at `public/fonts/OPTIEinstein-Black.otf`, you can load it with the config:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    fonts: [
      {
        name: 'optieinstein',
        weight: 800,
        // path must point to a public font file
        path: '/fonts/OPTIEinstein-Black.otf',
      }
    ],
  }
})
```

## Loading A Google Font

Google fonts are a bit easier, you can just use the name+weight of the font.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    fonts: [
      // will load the Noto Sans font from Google fonts
      'Noto+Sans:400'
    ]
  }
})
```

This will remove the `Inter` font dependency, so if you'd like to keep using it, you'll need to add it back.

## Template Custom Fonts

Sometimes you'll be rendering a custom template that you want to use a custom font with, without
having to load that font for all templates.

In this case, you can use the `fonts` prop on the `defineOgImage` component.

```ts
defineOgImage({
  fonts: [
    {
      name: 'optieinstein',
      weight: 800,
      path: '/fonts/OPTIEinstein-Black.otf',
    }
  ]
})
```

## Using A Custom Font In Your Template

To use your custom fonts, within your template you'll need to set the font-family.

```html
<div style="font-family: 'optieinstein'">
    <!-- ...  -->
</div>
```
