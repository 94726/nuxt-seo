title: 🔨 Satori Renderer
---

## Limitations

It's important to familiarize yourself with [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) before you make more complex templates.

If you find Satori too difficult to work with, you can use the `chromium` renderer instead.

### Layouts

- Satori does not support `inline`, `block` or `grid` layouts.

Everything is a flexbox with a `flex-direction` of `column`. You should design your templates with this in mind.


### Styling

- Satori itself only supports inline CSS

Nuxt OG Image has support for inlining CSS, but it's not available
on all environments (see the [compatibility guide](/og-image/guides/compatibility)).
It's recommended you use the in-built [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev) to style your templates.

### Images

- You must either link images as absolute URLs or relative to your public directory. You can't use
  images bundled through Vite.

```html
<img src="/my-image.png" />
```

- Prefer rendering  SVGs instead of inling them within `img` tags

```html
<!-- ❌ -->
<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,..." />
<!-- ✅ -->
<svg>
  <rect width="24" height="24" />
</svg>
```
