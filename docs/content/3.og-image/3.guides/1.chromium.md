title: ðŸ”¨ Chromium Renderer

By default, generating browser images is disabled at runtime. This is because it requires a headless browser to be installed.

## Enabling Runtime Browser Images

If you're using a compatible environment (node) and want to enable runtime browser images, you can do so with the following steps.

1. Install the `playwright` dependency.

```bash
npm i playwright
```

2. Enable the config

```ts [nuxt.config]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    runtimeBrowser: true
  }
})
```


## Limitations

### Requirements

Screenshots are taken by using a headless browser. A local Chrome browser is used by default.

In a CI environment a fallback chromium will be used.

If you still have issued you should install the [Playwright dependencies](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installation) manually.
