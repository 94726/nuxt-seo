Nuxt OG Image comes out-of-the-box with support for icons and emojis.

## Emojis Characters

You can use raw emoji in your images. Behind the scenes with is powered by [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji).

## Icons

You can use icons from [Nuxt Icons]() in your images, just make sure you have the module installed.


It's important to familiarize yourself with [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) before you make more complex templates.

Satori has limited capacity for rendering styles;
you should reference which ones are available within their documentation.

Out of the box, this module provides support for the following:
- Tailwind classes (Note: Satori Tailwind support is experimental, not all classes are supported)
- Google Fonts, default is Inter
- Emoji support with [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji)
- Relative image support (you should link images from your public directory `/my-image.png`)
- CSS `<style>` block support

If you find Satori is too limiting for your needs, you can always use the `browser` provider to capture browser screenshots instead.
