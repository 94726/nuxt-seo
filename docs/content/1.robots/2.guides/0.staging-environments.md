When working with more environments than just production and development,
it's highly recommended to provide an [Site Config](/site-config) `env` for your site.

This ensures that non-production environments are not indexed by search engines and avoids duplicate content issues.

## Setup

The easiest way to configure your environments is to set an environment variable for the `env`.

This is only needed for non-production environments, as the default value is `production` when your Nuxt app is built.

```
NUXT_SITE_ENV=preview
```

This is enough to ensure the module will not allow indexing of your site.
