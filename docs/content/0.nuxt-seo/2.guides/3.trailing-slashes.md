Nuxt SEO allows you to enable global trailing slashes using site config.

This will automatically add trailing slashes to your sitemap, canonical URLs and more.

```ts [nuxt.config]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    trailingSlash: true,
  }
})
```

## Handling Internal Links 

While Nuxt SEO can handle the correct trailing slashes for all of its own modules, it can't correct the behavior of
`<NuxtLink>` or other modules.

You will need to make sure you're using the correct slashes for these.

Alternatively, you can use the `<SiteLink>` component.

## <SiteLink>

This has the exact same API as `<NuxtLink>` but will provide extra link resolving features.

Using this component is especially useful for modules that may not have explicit context of how you've configured
your trailing slashes.

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Will be set to /about/ if trailingSlash is enabled -->
  <SiteLink to="/about">
    About
  </SiteLink>
</template>
```

### Props

- `withBase` - Will add the `app.baseURL` to the link
- `absolute` - Will render the link as an absolute path.
