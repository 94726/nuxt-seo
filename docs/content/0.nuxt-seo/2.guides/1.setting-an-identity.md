description: Make yourself or your Organization more prominent in search engines.
---

An identity clarifies to search engines who the owner of the site is. It can either be a `Person` or an `Organization`.

This API is subject to change before the v2 release. You may consider manually configuring your [Schema.org identity](https://unhead.unjs.io/schema-org/recipes/identity) instead.

---

Providing an `identiy` on your site config opts you into using a [Schema.org identity](todo) and will insert relevant meta tags.

As part of your identity, it's recommended to configure
your social media links as well.

```ts [Person]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    identity: {
      type: 'Person'
    },
    twitter: '@harlan-zw',
  }
})
```

```ts [Organization]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    identity: {
      type: 'Organization'
    },
    twitter: '@harlan-zw',
  }
})
```

Behind the scenes this will set up the correct Schema.org for you as well as setting extra meta tags.
