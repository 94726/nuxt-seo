## Breaking Changes 

### Module Rename `Nuxt SEO Kit` -> `Nuxt SEO`

The module has been renamed from `nuxt-seo-kit` to `nuxt-seo`. Smaller, easier to remember and provides a base for growing
out the Nuxt SEO ecosystem.

### `<SeoKit>`, `useSeoKit()` Removed

You will need to remove these. The functionality is replaced with a plugin.

```diff
<template>
-  <SeoKit />
</template>
```

If you'd like to opt-out of the behavior you can set [automaticDefaults](/nuxt-seo/api/config#automaticdefaults) to `false`.

### Nuxt Unhead renamed to Nuxt SEO Experiments

The module has been renamed from `nuxt-unhead` to `nuxt-seo-experiments`. This is to better reflect the purpose of the module.

If you were using the `unhead` key to configure the module, you will need to change it to `seoExperiments`.

```diff
export default defineNuxtConfig({
-  unhead: {
+  seoExperiments: {
  }
})
```
