## Can I Just Use The Modules Seperately?

Yes! Nuxt SEO is designed to be flexible and work however you need it to.

## What Happened To Nuxt Seo Kit?

The Nuxt SEO Kit module was the initial version of Nuxt SEO.

While it generally worked great for some users, it was only useful for server-side generated Nuxt Sites and in turn its feature
set was much more limited.

It has been deprecated in favour of the new Nuxt SEO module.
