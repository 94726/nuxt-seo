#title
Nuxt SEO is in beta.

#description
While it is ready and being used in production environments already, the documentation is still being written and some minor
API changes may occur.

It's recommended to keep an eye on the beta releases that come out.
::

1. Install `@nuxtseo/module` dependency to your project:

::code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm i -D @nuxtseo/module
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add -D @nuxtseo/module
```

```bash [npm]
npm install -D @nuxtseo/module
```

::

2. Add it to your `modules` section in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxtseo/module']
})
```

3. Learn about the modules

That's it!

All features are enabled by default. Learn more by exploring the documentation.
