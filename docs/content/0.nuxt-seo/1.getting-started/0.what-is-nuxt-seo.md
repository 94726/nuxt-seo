Nuxt SEO is both a collection of modules and a module itself. The Nuxt SEO module is all the SEO modules combined into one that is guaranteed to work well together.

- [Nuxt Simple Robots](/robots)
- [Nuxt Simple Sitemap](/sitemap)
- [Nuxt OG Image](/og-image)
- [Nuxt Schema.org](/schema-org)
- [Nuxt SEO Experiments](/experiments)
- [Nuxt Link Checker](/link-checker)

There is no right or wrong way to use Nuxt SEO. It's designed to be flexible and work however you need it to.

To minimise config and ensure the modules work well together, [Nuxt Site Config](/site-config) is installed automatically when using any of the modules.

## Nuxt SEO Module

Using the `@nuxtjs/seo` will provide you with less boilerplate and configuration to manage as well some additional features.

### :icon{name="noto:mage"} Fallback Titles

- Ensures that every page has a title by generating one from the last slug segment

### :icon{name="noto:mage"} Best Practice Defaults

- Canonical URLs will be automatically generated for all pages.
- Fallback title and title template will be set based on the page slug.
- Description and open-graph meta tags will be set for you based on [Nuxt Site Config](/site-config).

### :icon{name="noto:bread"} Breadcrumb composable

- Easily generate site-wide breadcrumb using the `useBreadcrumbItems` composable.
- Integrates with Nuxt I18n and Nuxt Schema.org
- Plugs directly into [Nuxt UI Breadcrumb](https://ui.nuxt.com/navigation/breadcrumb)
