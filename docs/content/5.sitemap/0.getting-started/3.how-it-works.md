description: Learn how the Nuxt Simple Sitemap module works so you can get the most out of it.
---

This module has been built to provide as simple of configuration as possible.

## Data Sources

To do this it will use many data sources to gather the best default configuration for your sitemap.
- Page files (on by default, disable with `inferStaticPagesAsRoutes: false`)
- Prerendered routes (see [Zero Config Prerendering](#zero-config-prerendering-optional))
- Dynamic routes (see [Handling dynamic URLs](#handling-dynamic-urls))

If you're using [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/):
- Content files (enabled with `documentDriven` mode, otherwise enable `strictNuxtContentPaths`)

## Filtering

It then will filter these URLs based on the following rules:
- Module Config / Sitemap Entry: `exclude` - Array of glob patterns to exclude from the sitemap
- Module Config / Sitemap Entry: `include` - Array of glob patterns to include in the sitemap
- Route Rules: `index` - Whether a specific page can be indexed, not indexable pages are excluded from the sitemap
