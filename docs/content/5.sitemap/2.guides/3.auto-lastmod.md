title: Auto Lastmod
description: Automatically generate the lastmod date for your sitemap entries.
---

By default, the sitemap module will automatically detect the `lastmod` date for each URL.

This is done by looking at the `mtime` of the page file associated with a route.

If a route can't be associated with a page file then the current date will be used.

You can disable this behaviour by setting `autoLastmod: false`.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    autoLastmod: false,
  },
})
```
