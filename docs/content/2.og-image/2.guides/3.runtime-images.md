title: Runtime Images
---

When using `nuxt build`, you can only use the `browser` provider with the `node` Nitro preset.

If you intend to use the `browser` provider in production, make sure you include the `playwright` dependency.

  ```bash
  npm i playwright
  ```

You can get around this by prerendering any pages that use `og:image`. Note that dynamic browser generated images are not supported at all,
you should use the Satori provider.


```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      crawlLinks: true, // recommended
      routes: [
        '/',
        // list all routes that use og:image if you're not using crawlLinks
        '/about',
        '/blog',
        '/blog/my-first-post',
      ]
    }
  }
})
```


## Compatibility

Both Satori and Browser will work in Node based environments. Prerendering is fully supported.

When you want to generate dynamic images at runtime there are certain Nitro runtime limitations.
