## Recommendations

It's recommended to use Nuxt Schema.org with Nuxt SSR enabled, meaning you shouldn't be running your app as an SPA.

This makes sure crawlers get your Schema.org data without
having to execute javascript as well as keeps your site fast for users.

## Setup

1. Install `nuxt-schema-org` dependency to your project:

::code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm i -D nuxt-schema-org
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add -D nuxt-schema-org
```

```bash [npm]
npm install -D nuxt-schema-org
```

::

2. Add it to your `modules` section in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-schema-org']
})
```

3. Configure your site details.

It's recommended to set a canonical site URL to avoid duplicate content issues, as well as a site name
for better default configuration.

The easiest way to add it in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    url: 'https://example.com',
    name: 'My Website',
  }
})
```

To learn about other ways to configure your site config, head over to the [Nuxt Site Config docs](/site-config/getting-started/how-it-works).
