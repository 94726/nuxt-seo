title: Prerender Requirements
description: Learn how to use Nuxt Site Config to make sure your prerendering build step works.

When prerendering pages as part of your build step, you may need to provide some additional configuration.

- A site URL is required to generate absolute URLs for sitemaps.

For Vercel and Netlify, this is automatically provided by the environment variables `VERCEL_URL` and `URL` respectively.

Otherwise, you can provide it in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    // if not using environment variables
    url: 'https://example.com',
  },
})
```

This is powered by the [nuxt-site-config](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-site-config) module.
See the documentation for alternative ways to configure your site config.
