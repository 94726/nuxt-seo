title: Prerendering
description: Perender your pages and have them all automatically added to your sitemap.
---

This module can automatically discover prerendered routes and add them to your sitemap. 

## Enabling Prerendering

If you have some dynamic routes that need to be in your sitemap but you don't want to create a custom API endpoint,
you can simply enable full prenderer.

You will need to use configuration to enable this feature.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      crawlLinks: true,
      routes: [
        '/',
      ]
    }
  }
})
```

## Automatic Tags

For each discovered prerendered route it will:
- add image entries `<image:image>` (when `discoverImages` option is enabled)
- add lastmod date (when `autoLastmod` isn't disabled).

To ensure images are discovered for the sitemap, make sure you main site content is wrapped with a `<main>` tag.
