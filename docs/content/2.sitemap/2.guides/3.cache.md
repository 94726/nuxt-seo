description: Use the default cache engine to keep your sitemaps fast.

Caching your sitemap can help reduce the load on your server and improve performance.

By default, the cache is enabled on production environments and sitemaps will be cached for 1 hour.

### Cache Time

You can change the cache time by setting the `cacheTtl` option. This is the amount of milliseconds to cache the sitemap for.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    cacheTtl: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 // 1 day
  }
})
```

If you want to disable caching, set the `cacheTtl` to `0`.

### Cache Driver

The cache engine is set to the Nitro default of the `cache/` path.

If you want to customise the cache engine, you can set the `runtimeCacheStorage` option.

```ts [nuxt.config]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    // cloudflare kv binding example
    runtimeCacheStorage: {
      driver: 'cloudflare-kv-binding',
      binding: 'OG_IMAGE_CACHE'
    }
  }
})
```

### Purging the Cache

If you want to purge the cache, you can pass the query param `?purge` to the sitemap.xml URL.

For example:

```bash
https://example.com/sitemap.xml?purge
```

### Debugging the Cache

You can see if the sitemap is being cached by checking the response headers.

Every sitemap request will return:
- `X-Sitemap-Cache` cache status, either `HIT`, `MISS`, or `PURGE`
- `X-Sitemap-Cache-Expires` when the sitemap will expire
