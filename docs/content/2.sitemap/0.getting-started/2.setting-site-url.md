title: Setting A Site URL
description: Set a site URL when using nuxt-simple-sitemap to avoid prerendering and runtime issues.

Out-of-the-box the module is powered by [Nuxt Site Config](/site-config/getting-started/background).

The Nuxt Site Config module will try and automatically setup your site URL for you when you generate your
sitemap at runtime.

It's recommended to always set a canonical site URL to avoid duplicate content issues.

## Set a Site URL

The easiest way to set a site URL is to provide it in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    url: 'https://example.com',
  },
})
```

Otherwise, you can use an `.env` file or environment variables.

```bash [.env]
NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

For other ways to set your site URL, see the [Nuxt Site Config documentation](/site-config/getting-started/how-it-works).
