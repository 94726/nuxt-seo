title: Prerender Requirements
description: Learn how to use Nuxt Site Config to make sure your prerendering build step works.
---

When prerendering pages as part of your build step, you may need to provide some additional configuration.

- A site URL is required to generate canonical URLs for your sitemap.

Otherwise, you can provide it in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    url: 'https://example.com',
  },
})
```

Otherwise, you can use an `.env` file or environment variables.

```bash [.env]
NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

This is powered by the [nuxt-site-config](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-site-config) module.
See the documentation for alternative ways to configure your site config.
