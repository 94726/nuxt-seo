# Robots.txt

The recommendation way to implement your robots.txt configuration,
is to simply create a `robots.txt` file in your project root or assets folder.

For environments that are indexable,
this file will be parsed and merged with the module config.

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /secret
```

If you'd prefer to load your `robots.txt` file from a different path, you can use the `mergeWithRobotsTxtPath` config.

#### Public folder

You're free to place your `robots.txt` in your `<rootDir>/public` folder,
however, you won't benefit from all the features of this module.
